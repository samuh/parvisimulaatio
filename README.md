parvisimulaatio
===============
####All the code was written in early 2014

Scala school project for simple flock simulation with file save/load and rules such as:
  - Collision area
  - Collision weight
  - Flock size
  - Alignment
  - Cohesion
  - Target

Also includes rule, collision, flock area and info visualization.
By default birds follow cursor which can be locked in to position and released with left mouse button.

Delay frequency corresponds refresh rate.

Simulation does **NOT** use real world physics simulation like weight, acceleration and speed, which makes it very elementary.
